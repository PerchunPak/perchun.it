I think I will not rewrite the site to Astro, as it doesn't really matter. I'm a backend develepor,
so it is actually more important for site to be prettier, not faster. The branch will just stay for
the history. (And anyway, I love Astro).

If you want to see my progress, checkout to this branch (`git checkout astro`), run `yarn install`
and then just run `yarn dev` to start the dev server. Open `localhost:3000` in your browser and see
the result!

My personal site, [check it](https://perchun.it)!
