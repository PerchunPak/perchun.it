# pinger-bot

Discord bot to get status from (and collect statistics of) Minecraft servers, which is my first ever created project, that lived more than a few days. I often test here new tools or even architectures.

As it was written in the sidebar, I enjoy connecting a lot of different new technologies into one,
small on the first look, project.
This one is not an exception, I actually got my first experience with i18n (translation of the app) here.
There is also used [APScheduler](https://pypi.org/project/APScheduler/)
(although I now prefer a simpler solution,
like `while True:` loop in the background with calling my function and
`asyncio.sleep` (async is gorgeous in Python btw)).

You can also notice that I used fairly complex and powerful library [SQLAlchemy (ORM version)](https://sqlalchemy.org/)
(and [alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/) for something called migrations -
automatic DB updates without any loss of data and manual intervention
during adding a new table or even a row into already existing table).
I also used an advantage of these libraries,
and the bot supports all three popular SQL databases
([SQLite](https://sqlite.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org)),
even CI tests all possible combinations of ~4 supported different Python versions and DBs.

### Technologies that I have used here:

- [Hikari-py](https://www.hikari-py.dev/) - library for connecting to Discord. Similar to [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), but [different](https://www.reddit.com/r/Discord_Bots/comments/o6jj55/discordpy_vs_hikari/).
- [APScheduler](https://pypi.org/project/APScheduler/) - for scheduling execution of a function. Here it is used to collect statistics once in a while.
- [mcstatus](https://mcstatus.readthedocs.io/) - for getting data from servers (I'm [a maintainer of this library](/mcstatus) now).
- [SQLAlchemy ORM](https://sqlalchemy.org/) - for connecting to the database (I currently support [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org)).
- [alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/) - for database migrations.
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - for creating statistics graphs.
- [gettext](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html) - for translating into different languages (i18n).
- [Babel](https://babel.pocoo.org/) - for helping in translating. It adds a bit of tooling to e.g. fetch strings for translations.
- [Docker](https://docker.com/) - for running on my server.
