# Other projects

There are some projects that aren't worth an own page.
If they are too small, or not impressive, but still interesting, they all go here.

## [svelte-template](https://github.com/PerchunPak/svelte-template)

Similar to [python-template](/python-template), but for Svelte projects.
It also uses coockiecutter for templating,
and generates a project with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).

## [optional-faker](https://github.com/PerchunPak/optional-faker)

Simple library to wrap values generated by [faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) and returning `None` with 50% probability.

## [short-it](https://github.com/PerchunPak/short-it)

Home-grown link shortener that I used for links like to GitHub of the project.
It is now deprecated because people don't really trust link shorteners,
and I didn't find a use-case where it would be better that direct link.

## [apykuma](https://github.com/PerchunPak/apykuma)

A small library for pinging [my](https://kuma.perchun.it) [Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma#readme) every N seconds. It works only with async and is used everywhere, where there is a server part, but no easy way to check if it is up (e.g. bots or scripts).

## [twitch-stream-notifier](https://github.com/PerchunPak/twitch-stream-notifier)

A simple script to notify me when someone on Twitch will go live. Even if the purpose is simple, I used there [python-template](/python-template) so there are quite a lot of code (like [Sentry](https://sentry.io) or config in YAML).
