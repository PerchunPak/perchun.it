# Other projects

There are some projects that aren't worth an own page.
If they are too small, or not impressive, but still interesting, they all go here.

## [NixOS](https://nixos.org) ([nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs))

nixpkgs is a package registry for NixOS, fully declarative (there are no hidden dependencies) reproducable (you can built exactly the same binary even by hash on completely different systems) OS built on top of Nix package manager.

- Added [gh-copilot](https://github.com/github/gh-copilot) (Copilot CLI plugin for GitHub CLI) - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/297073
- Added [cruft](https://pypi.org/project/cruft/) (tool that helps me autoupdate my templates) - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/299346
- Fixed build for [pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/) (extremely popular library for data validation) on Python 3.9 - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/299350

And [a bunch of others](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls/PerchunPak).

## [svelte-template](https://github.com/PerchunPak/svelte-template)

Similar to [python-template](/python-template), but for Svelte projects.
It also uses coockiecutter for templating,
and generates a project with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).

## [optional-faker](https://github.com/PerchunPak/optional-faker)

Simple library to wrap values generated by [faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) and returning `None` with 50% probability.

## [short-it](https://github.com/PerchunPak/short-it)

Home-grown link shortener that I used for links like to GitHub of the project.
It is now deprecated because people don't really trust link shorteners,
and I didn't find a use-case where it would be better that direct link.

## [apykuma](https://github.com/PerchunPak/apykuma)

A small library for pinging [my](https://kuma.perchun.it) [Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma#readme) every N seconds. It works only with async and is used everywhere, where there is a server part, but no easy way to check if it is up (e.g. bots or scripts).

## [twitch-stream-notifier](https://github.com/PerchunPak/twitch-stream-notifier)

A simple script to notify me when someone on Twitch will go live. Even if the purpose is simple, I used there [python-template](/python-template) so there are quite a lot of code (like [Sentry](https://sentry.io) or config in YAML).
