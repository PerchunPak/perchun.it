# the-war-tracker-bot

A Telegram bot, that was intended to prevent me from doomscrolling, but actually just fed me with russian propaganda.

Bot logged in as a user and was subscribed to 500 channels with war news (from both sides).
Then news was filtered by keyword and sent to me.
There were some shenanigans in between, but those are technical details.

Unfortunately, it turns out that russians just spam with whatever thing they think (what a surprise).
This makes my bot just useless, as on one true news were 10 russian fakes and propaganda.
As well as there were a lot of just duplicates of the same thing,
and I couldn't look into the past, looking for news on the interesting theme that was filtered out.

After I realized that this project is a fail, to me came a new idea: global archiver of the war news.
It is not a secret that news about the war is mostly shared on Telegram,
and I expect that after Ukrainians win, bad people will cover up traces.
So archiving their crimes now should be helpful in the future.

My idea was
to create a public website that will provide easy methods to see global news from both sides at the given time.
Half of the project (or at least one third) is already written as this bot.
However, I expected that data would eat a lot of space
(I approximated expenses to 20$/month on storage, and not speaking about Telegram accounts or hosting).

I even wrote an email to one popular war-crimes archiver (though they archived only photos at the time), but got no response. If you're interested in something like this, please [contact me](mailto:twtb@perchun.it).

### Technologies that I have used here:

- [Telethon](https://pypi.org/project/Telethon/) - library for connecting to Telegram with MTProto protocol, which is what mobile apps use. So basically connecting as a user-bot.
- [Redis](https://redis.io) - key-value database, usually used for caching, but here used as a primary database (because it is ⚡blazingly⚡ fast and I felt that SQL is an overkill for this project)
