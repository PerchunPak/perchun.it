# mcstatus

Python library to ping and get status from Minecraft servers. It doesn't just return you `ok` or `not ok`, you can also get the server icon, description, player count, etc. Interesting that this library is mostly used by Discord bot developers (even I found this library because I wanted a Discord bot for my Minecraft server, what a perfect use case).

I have been a core maintainer of the library for almost a year now and have added a lot of new stuff there.
One of my biggest contributions was the first one.
I [rewrote](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/pull/306) the entire system of interaction between the library and users using [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)
(if you are not familiar with what it is, it is just a simpler,
faster way to write simple classes that only store data; much nicer and typed than dicts;
everyone should try it).
Since this rewrite took a lot of time,
it so happened that I made many other contributions to this library and became a maintainer!

And one more interesting fact: the library was created by [Dinnerbone](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Nathan_Adams), who is a technical director at Mojang Studios now, [13 years ago](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/commit/b463a4b9196d7e34883be33a4322e095b1073a41).

#### Features of the library made by me:

- New fancy [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) as return values, instead of [10-year-old](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/commit/94264f22ea70cf8c07bbab6f97f647cde3b1cde2) unpythonic nested classes. (**[#306](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/pull/306)**)
- Completely new parsing system for server description (MOTD). Before, you could only get a string of it with some Minecraft color codes, and now you can transform it to anything! As an example, we implemented [24bit ANSI transformer and HTML transformer](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/blob/48d786889fc0ab3ad36f4367ae580c50ff155e96/mcstatus/motd/transformers.py). (**[#335](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/pull/335)**)
- Documentation that describes every public (and not only) method, as well as examples of how to use it and FAQ. Can you imagine that before like a year ago, this library didn't have **any** docs and we (maintainers) suggested that users read source code to know how to use a library? (**[#477](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/pull/477)**)
- Using the [`with` block](https://peps.python.org/pep-0343/) to open and close connections (**[#422](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/pull/422)**).
- And about [60 other PRs](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/pulls/PerchunPak) that are not important enough to mention here.

### Technologies that are used here:

- [dnspython](https://dnspython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - for DNS SRV record lookup
- [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright#readme) - linter for supporting statically typed Python. Was chosen instead of [mypy](https://www.mypy-lang.org/) because it was faster, not true anymore though. See [this document](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/mypy-comparison.md) if you are interested in how it is different from mypy, [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/issues/699) to read why we don't use mypy and [this page](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+typed+python) to know what is typed Python.
- And a few more features like [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (I mean, it is a standard for all my projects now), [poetry-dynamic-versioning](https://pypi.org/project/poetry-dynamic-versioning/) to control package version with git tags, instead of just committing `Bump version` before every release. I won't go into details much, because I wasn't really involved in those decisions. It was done before I became a maintainer.
