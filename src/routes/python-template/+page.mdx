# python-template

Cookiecutter template for my every Python project. The collection of fundamental things for all of them. Check it to see most of my coding habits!

I spend little time creating a new project. It's all thanks to this project - it's my personal template. It contains a set of the best tools I've found in all my experience.

### Technologies that I have used here:

- [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter#readme) - for easy template creation
- [lice](https://pypi.org/project/lice/) - for generating the project license
- [cruft](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/) - for auto-updating template
- [OmegaConf](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/) - for configuration files with Yaml
- [structlog](https://structlog.org) - for beautiful and structed logging
- [mypy](https://www.mypy-lang.org/) - linter for supporting statically typed Python
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) - advanced package manager, my favorite tool
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) - for running automatic testing on every commit
- [pytest](https://pytest.org/) - for testing with easy-to-write unit-tests
- QA with **[flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/)** and about five addons to it
- [Sphinx](https://python-poetry.org/) - for generating documentation from [.RST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) files
- documentation with **[Sphinx](https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/)**, **[Furo](https://pypi.org/project/furo/)** theme and **[ReadTheDocs.org](https://readthedocs.org)** for hosting
