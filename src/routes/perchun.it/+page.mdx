# This site!

It was firstly written in [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org), but then after some experience with frontend development, it is now in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). It uses a cute UI toolkit named [Skeleton](https://www.skeleton.dev/), which itself is built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The site also has [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) support (using [`mdsvex`](https://mdsvex.com) library). In fact, this page is written in Markdown.

I also had a bunch of experience with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com) (side story again: I actually rewrote this site for the third time! Before [Skeleton](https://www.skeleton.dev/), I used [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com)).

I believe that every programmer should have their own domain, and maybe a website on it. It's incredibly convenient to keep some of your personal things there (for example, running projects or your portfolio/resume). So I bought such a year ago, [perchun.it](https://perchun.it), and to fill my homepage with something, I wrote my portfolio site. This is how my journey to frontend began. And as you may see, I mentioned that I am only backend developer, don't like at all the whole frontend state and technologies used to build software here.

Although I have some experience in Frontend development, I would not like to continue this practice. Backend development is much more challenging and interesting. I mean, Frontend is challenging as well, just in Backend I don't need to bruteforce a way to center div every time I need (sometimes flex and margin-auto works, sometimes align-center and who knows why). And still, I come back to this horrible experience every once in a while.

### Technologies that I have used here:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) - a fast and light frontend framework, which is _just_ better and easier than React, which I used before
- ~~[daisyUI](https://daisyui.com) - super elegant and cool UI library, which is framework independent and is built using only Tailwind CSS. This site wouldn't be so nice at all without it. At the end of the day, I am not a designer.~~
- [Skeleton](https://skeleton.dev) - colorful, nice and cute UI toolkit with a collection of Svelte-specific components as well as some CSS-only solutions. I finally don't have to write modals from scratch!
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - the new awesome approach to CSS. If you're currently using only vanilla CSS, highly recommend trying this out. It even inserts some weird legacy fixes to your CSS.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - JavaScript with types.
