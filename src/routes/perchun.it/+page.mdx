# This site!

My first Frontend project. It was firstly written in [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org), but then after some experience with frontend development, it is now in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). It uses [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) library for nice cute look of the site, which itself is built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The site also has [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) support. In fact, this paragraph is written in Markdown.

I believe that every programmer should have their own domain, and maybe a website on it. It's incredibly convenient to keep some of your personal things there (for example, running projects or your portfolio/resume). So I bought such a year ago, [perchun.it](https://perchun.it), and to fill my homepage with something, I wrote my portfolio site. This is how my journey to frontend beginned. And as you may see, I mentioned that I am only backend developer, don't like at all the whole frontend state and technologies used to build software here.

### Technologies that I have used here:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) - a fast and light frontend framework, which is just better and easier than React, which I used before
- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com) - super cute and cool UI library, which is framework independent and is built using only Tailwind CSS. This site wouldn't be so nice at all without it. At the end of the day, I am not a designer
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - the new awesome approach to CSS
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - JavaScript with types
