# StatusMC

You maybe know other same services for pinging Minecraft servers, like https://mcstatus.io or https://mcsrvstat.us.
And you may ask, why do we need another one? Well, the answer is not so simple. Firstly, I wanted to write this project
to resolve [this feature request](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/issues/157) and add another project to my portfolio.
But the idea of building same service as there are wasn't accepted. Anyway, I started to build this project by myself,
and during the development, I found the feature to add, that it will not look like just the same service.

This feature is modules system. At other services, you can only get the server status (java or bedrock), but here you can
get Java status, Bedrock status and Query answer in *one* request! These three request are done in parallel on the backend
(aka our API), so you don't need to even know how does asynchronous programming work or what are threads. You can also
set different IPs for each module, so you can get Java status from one server and Bedrock status from another one.

Also, each answer is hardly typed with [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev)'s models, so user can always look at sources
if I will forget to update docs. This also ensures stability of the API, because if there will be any mistake in
types - there will be an error on our side, not users! (We track those with [Sentry](https://sentry.io), so we have a guy who will spam my email if something will go wrong).

I would also like to say big "Thank you!" to https://mcstatus.io and https://mcsrvstat.us, as I used some of their assets
and ideas to create this project.

### Technologies that I have used here:

#### Backend

- [mcstatus](/mcstatus) - StatusMC is just a wrapper of mcstatus, so you can use this library from web.
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - incredibly fast and pythonicly easy backend framework.
- [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) - powerful and strict library to validate data (e.g. what server returns to us or what we return).
- [cachetools](https://pypi.org/project/cachetools/) & [asyncache](https://pypi.org/project/asyncache/) - for caching backend answers, so we wont spam the server behind if status was requested by two independent users in the same time.

#### Frontend

At the time of the writing site, I was annoyed of my Next.js portfolio, so I chose to use as less as possible JS. It resulted into total of ~200 kilobytes of compresed JS.

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - JS meta-framework for creating HTML with as less as possible JS (it renders everything during build, which is different to e.g. React which renders everything on every request).
- [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/) - extremely simple and small JS framework.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - the new awesome approach to CSS. If you're currently using only vanilla CSS, highly recommend trying this out. It even inserts some weird legacy fixes to your CSS.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - JavaScript with types.
