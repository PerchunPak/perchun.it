# czech-plus

As I'm in Czech Republic now, I need to learn Czech fastly. This is why I created an addon for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net)! For me, the addon helps learning and adding new words.

This addon helps you (and me actually) to learn new words deeply, add them to your vocabulary, and learn productively. I wrote a whole amount of code to make it work, like tests which are testing like 50 test cases using parametrization and randomization (kind of anti-pattern, but they're kind of impressive too) or custom syntax parsing. So I probably could say, that I wrote a custom non-Turing complete programming language to just study Czech words.

### Technologies that I have used here:

- [Lexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) - breaking the input text into tokens
- [Parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) - further analysis of these tokens and their conversion into the output text
