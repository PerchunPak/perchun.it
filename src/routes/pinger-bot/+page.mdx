# pinger-bot

Discord bot to ping (and collect statistics of) Minecraft servers, which is my main project, where I test new tools, or even architectures.

It's my longest project that's still being supported. I started writing it when I have first started programming. It's a Discord bot that receives public information from Minecraft servers and can generate statistics on the number of players. But this is not the most important thing, the most important thing is that it is my testing ground for new ideas and libraries. I often find interesting tools or even ecosystem sites and test them with this bot.

### Technologies that I have used here:

- [Hikari-py](https://www.hikari-py.dev/) - library for connecting to Discord
- [APScheduler](https://pypi.org/project/APScheduler/) - for collecting statistics once in a while
- [mcstatus](https://mcstatus.readthedocs.io/) - for getting data from servers
- [SQLAlchemy ORM](https://sqlalchemy.org/) - for connecting to the database (I currently support [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org))
- [alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/) - for database migrations
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - for creating statistics graphs
- [gettext](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html) - for translating into different languages
- [Babel](https://babel.pocoo.org/) - for helping in translating
- [Docker](https://docker.com/) - for running on my server
