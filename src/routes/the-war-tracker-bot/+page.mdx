# the-war-tracker-bot

The Telegram bot that doom-scrolls through the war news for you!

I'm a person who often finds myself doomscrolling, and I'm not a big fan of it. But I really want to follow the latest news in Ukraine (more specifically, about the war). Instead of following hundreds of telegram channels - I can finally use this bot! This bot follows a bunch of telegram channels and sends you the news you need!

Example: When I saw the news that a missile had landed in Poland, I wanted to follow the news, but I didn't want to scroll through the night.

I'm sure this happens with a lot of news. At the time, I wanted a channel that reported only the most important news - but this has its drawbacks. The line of the "importance" is subjective for everyone, and such a channel would require the authors to reveal a lot of their thoughts, which I didn't want, so I didn't create something like that.

### Technologies that I have used here:

- [Telethon](https://pypi.org/project/Telethon/) - library for connecting to Telegram with MTProto protocol, which is what use mobile apps
- [Redis](https://redis.io) - key-value database, mostly used for caching
