# mcstatus

Python library to ping and get status from Minecraft servers. It doesn't just return you `ok` or `not ok`, you can also get the server icon, description, player count, etc. Interesting that this library is mostly used by Discord bot developers (even I found this library because I wanted a Discord bot for my Minecraft server, what a perfect use case).

I have been a core maintainer of the library for almost a year now and have added a lot of new stuff there. One of my biggest contributions was the first one, I [rewrote](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/pull/306) the entire system of interaction between the library and users using [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) (if you are not familiar what it is, it is just a simpler, faster way to write simple classes that only store data; much nicer and typed than dicts; everyone should try it). Since this rewrite took a lot of time, it so happened that I made many other contributions to this library and became a maintainer!

And one more interesting fact: the library was created by [Dinnerbone](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Nathan_Adams), who is a technical director at Mojang Studios now, [13 years ago](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/commit/b463a4b9196d7e34883be33a4322e095b1073a41).

### Technologies that I have used here:

- [dnspython](https://dnspython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - for DNS SRV record lookup
- [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright#readme) - linter for supporting statically typed Python. Much faster than [mypy](https://www.mypy-lang.org/) because it is written in Node.js. See [this document](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/mypy-comparison.md) if you are interesting in how it is different from mypy, [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/issues/699) to read why we don't use mypy and [this page](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+typed+python) to know what is typed Python
- and all other features from [python-template](/python-template)

**Features of the library made by me:**

- Rewriting of response objects to the latest system using the [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) module (**[#306](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/pull/306)**).
- Completely new parsing system for server description (MOTD) (**[#335](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/pull/335)**).
- Documentation (almost from scratch) (**[#477](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/pull/477)**).
- Using the `with` block to open and close connections (**[#422](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/pull/422)**).
- And about [50 other PRs](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/pulls/PerchunPak) that are not important enough to mention here.
